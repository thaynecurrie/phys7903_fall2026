# _Python for Scientific Data Analysis_

# 1. Syllabus

# 2. Course Topical Overview

We will cover the Basics of Python and Python Data Structures first, then we will discuss specific packages -- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and AstroPy.   We will include discussion of advanced data analysis techniques -- e.g. numerical linear algebra, PCA, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian inference -- and will _try_ to some additional topics.

Below are some more details about these topics.

## Basics of Python

* Printing/variables
* Prompting, Type Conversions, Argument Passing, and Reading/Writing
* Functions
* If-Then Statements, Looping

## Data Structures

* Tuples, Lists, Arrays, and Dictionaries

``d=[5,6,7]`` # a list
``dtuple=tuple(d) #now a tuple``

 ``c=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])``

* Slicing 

``a[3,4,5,6]; b=a[1:2]``

* Sequence Functions, Comprehensions, and Lambda Functions

``zipped=zip(seq1,seq2)``

## NumPy

* NumPy Arrays

``a=np.array([np.e,np.pi],dtype='float128')``

* Array Arithmetic and Universal Functions

``arr = np.array([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]]); arr2=1/arr``

* Array Slicing and Reshaping

``print(arr2d[:2, 1:]); arr.reshape(2,3)``

* More Array Operations and Array Broadcasting

``np.vstack([newarr,newarr2]); np.tile(arr,(2,1))``

* Basic Linear Algebra with NumPy and SciPy

``linalg.solve(a,b)``

* More Advanced Linear Algebra with NumPy and SciPy: SVD, PCA

## SciPy

  * Stats
  * Optimization 
  * Root Finding 
  * Interpolation 
  * Signal Processing
  * Hypothesis Testing (frequentist perspective)

## Matplotlib

 * Plotting Basics
 * Subplots and Axes Configurations 
 * Shadings, Histograms, Contour Plots, and Images 
 * Other Plottable Things


## AstroPy

* FITS Files and Image Display (with Matplotlib)
* Units, Constants, and Coordinates
* AstroQuery (Working with Databases), URL Queries
* Simple Photometry and Spectroscopy
* Time Series Data, Lomb-Scargle Periodigrams

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods and Bayesian Inference

* The Monte Carlo Method (overview), Posterior Distributions
* The Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC)/Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
* More MCMC Methodology (burn-in, autocorrelation)
* Tuning MCMC


# 3. What is needed for this Class from You

* a laptop computer
* Python-3.8 or later installed on your laptop under the Anaconda Python distribution with the following packages installed: Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, AstroPy, Astroquery, Corner, and Emcee and other packages as announced. 

  My recommendation: create a separate Anaconda Python environment for this class to avoid clashes with your normal codes. If you don't know how to do that, I can show you.  **DO NOT PROCRASTINATE WITH THE ANACONDA PYTHON INSTALLATION!**

* Zoom installed on your laptop.  [in case of AV problems in the room]  
* Markdown (recommended but not required) [for Mac OS, "MacDown" is quite good and simple to use]
* A Github Account (recommended but not required)

# 4. How The Class Will Work

* Lecture Notes - will be on Github in at least the Jupyter Notebook format (also likely in Markdown and PDF).  Before class, I will upload the day's lecture notes to Github.  

* Homework (80% of grade) - to be submitted in the form of Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts (i.e. *.py) with clear and easy instructions for execution.  We will have a significant amount of reserved class time to work on homework.

* Class Projects (20% of grade) - You will devise and work on a focused Python coding project relevant to your own interests that goes beyond material covered in this class.   This could be original code you write yourself or analysis of data with a sophisticated pipeline/analysis package not covered in the class. The subject matter will be approved by me.   You are allowed to work in groups of up to 3 for this assignment, provided that each member directly contributes an equal amount to the project.

# 5. Other Notes ...

* This is a (still) new course! 

* Computer Setup/Anaconda Installation

**MacOS** - [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#macos-linux-installation]()
[I recommend the Command Line installer, I will show my installation notes as an example; note the warnings about ARM vs Intel Macs] 

**Linux** - [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#linux-installer]()

**Windows** - ... go buy a Mac or uninstall Windows & install Linux instead

OR

[https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#windows-installation]()

[warning: the Windows installation is trickier than for MacOS or Linux.  Make sure to try this well in advance --reading documentation rather carefully-- and ask for help from others if you get stuck]

**How do you know it worked???**

Go into Terminal (if you are using Mac/Linux) or perhaps Anaconda powershell (if you are using Windows), type "python" (which should bring up Python prompt), and then type (on successive lines)

```
import numpy as np
print(np.random.rand(10))
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(np.random.rand(10),np.random.rand(10))
plt.show()
```
You should see a plot pop up showing a bunch of dots with values between 0 and 1 for both x and y.
